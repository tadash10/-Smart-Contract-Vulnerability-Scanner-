# -Smart-Contract-Vulnerability-Scanner-

This script is designed to analyze the security of Ethereum smart contracts using static and dynamic analysis techniques. It is implemented in Python and adheres to ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 12207 standards.

Installation:

    Clone the repository from Github:

bash

git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git

    Navigate to the project directory:

bash

cd Smart-Contract-Security-Analyzer

    Install the required Python packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage:

    Start the script by running:

css

python main.py

    The script will display a menu with the following options:

    Perform Static Analysis
    Perform Dynamic Analysis
    Authenticate User
    Authorize User
    Encrypt Data
    Decrypt Data
    Requirements Management
    Design
    Testing
    Maintenance
    Identify Risks
    Assess Risks
    Mitigate Risks
    Exit

    Choose an option by entering the corresponding number.

    If you choose to perform static or dynamic analysis, you will be prompted to enter the contract source code or contract address, respectively.

    If you choose to authenticate or authorize a user, you will be prompted to enter a username and password or user ID and permission, respectively.

    If you choose to encrypt or decrypt data, you will be prompted to enter the data and encryption/decryption key, respectively.

    If you choose to manage requirements, design, test, or maintain software, you will be prompted to enter the necessary information.

    If you choose to identify, assess, or mitigate risks, you will be prompted to enter the relevant information.

    The script will display the results of the selected option or perform the selected action.

Features:

    Input validation: The script validates user input to ensure that it is of the correct type and format.

    Error handling: The script handles errors gracefully and provides helpful error messages.

    Multiple contract scanning: The user can scan multiple contracts in one run by entering a list of contract addresses or file paths.

    Output formatting: The reports generated by the static and dynamic analysis tools have improved output formatting, including headings, tables, and color coding to make the reports more readable.

    Logging: The script logs the progress of the analysis and records any errors that occur.

    Integration with CI/CD tools: The script can be integrated with CI/CD tools to automate the analysis process and ensure that it is run on every code change.

    Integration with security scanners: The script can be integrated with third-party security scanners such as Snyk or Veracode to provide additional security checks and alerts.
