#To add error handling, you can use Python's try and except statements to catch and handle errors that may occur during runtime. For example, if an error occurs during contract scanning, you can print an error message and exit the program as follows:

try:
    slither_report = slither.analyze(source=contract_source)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error occurred during contract scanning: {e}")
    sys.exit(1)
