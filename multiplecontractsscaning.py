#To allow the user to scan multiple contracts in one run, you can prompt the user to enter a list of contract addresses or file paths using Python's input() function and splitting the input string into a list using split(). Then, you can loop over the list of contract addresses and perform static and dynamic analysis on each contract as follows:To allow the user to scan multiple contracts in one run, you can prompt the user to enter a list of contract addresses or file paths using Python's input() function and splitting the input string into a list using split(). Then, you can loop over the list of contract addresses and perform static and dynamic analysis on each contract as follows:
